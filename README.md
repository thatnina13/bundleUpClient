client for bundleUp
# bundleUpClient
This is a SPA web application which allows users to donate unwanted clothing directly to members of their community.  Users will be able to send create, read, update and delete items via the browser, to a back end ruby on rails API.

Unsolved Problems: I have a bug with my onSuccess messages for update and delete- they are functional but the message immediately flips back to the onSuccess message associate for view items. Additionally, I ran into some difficulty with my .show and .hide functionality- for some reason .show and .hide effect my user messages.
