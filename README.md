client for bundleUp
# bundleUpClient
The goal was to create a full stack application that can CRUD on a single resource. When I thought about what a data base is, conceptually, I also thought about what in my life is fairly similar to a database: my closet. From there it was a pretty easy road to bundleUp. 

The Process & Problem Solving
I began the process by building out the api and then slowly and painstakingly trying to connect that API to the front end, user facing experience. 

Remaining Unsolved ProblemsI have some difficulty with show and hide as well as an object that I can't seem to identify and thusly remove. Additionally, I would like to create future versions which would allow a person to search available items by zipcode, add and image to a posting, send a request for an item or a selection of items, and be able to confirm pick up of items which would result in those items being taken off site.
